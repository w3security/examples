# Feature Flags with Optimizely

This example shows how to use Optimizely to conduct experiments using Edge Middleware.

## Demo

https://feature-flag-optimizely.vercel.app

## One-Click Deploy

**Note:** Before clicking `Deploy`, follow the section [Set up Optimizely](#set-up-optimizely) to create an account, set up feature flags and obtain the Optimizely _SDK Key_.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/edge-middleware/feature-flag-optimizely&env=OPTIMIZELY_SDK_KEY&project-name=feature-flag-optimizely&repository-name=feature-flag-optimizely)

### Clone and Deploy

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bootstrap the example.

**Note:** Before running locally, follow the section [Set up Optimizely](#set-up-optimizely) to create an account, set up feature flags and obtain the Optimizely _SDK Key_.

Generate the Next JS app using this example

```
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/edge-middleware/feature-flag-optimizely feature-flag-optimizely
# or
yarn create-next-app --example https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/edge-middleware/feature-flag-optimizely feature-flag-optimizely
```

Create a local environment file from example and add your Optimizely _SDK Key_.

```
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Run Next.js in development mode:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

# or

yarn
yarn dev
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=edge-middleware-eap) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

# Optimizely Full Stack Feature Flags and Experimentation

[Optimizely Full Stack](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/docs) is a feature flagging and experimentation platform for websites, mobile apps, chatbots, APIs, smart devices, and anything else with a network connection.

You can deploy code behind feature flags, experiment with A/B tests, and roll out or roll back features immediately. All of this functionality is available with minimal performance impact through easy-to-use, open source SDKs.

You can use Optimizely feature flags at the edge with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) applications deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). This example uses Optimizely [Javascript SDK](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/v4.0/docs/javascript-node) inside a [Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-middleware) as a starting point for you to implement experimentation and feature flagging for your experiences at the edge. For a guide to getting started with our platform more generally, this can be combined with the steps outlined in our [Javascript Quickstart](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/v4.0/docs/javascript-node).

### Identity Management

Out of the box, Optimizely's Full Stack SDKs require a user-provided identifier to be passed in at runtime to drive experiment and feature flag decisions. This example generates a unique id, stores it in a cookie and reuses it to make the decisions sticky. Another common approach would be to use an existing unique identifier available within your application.

### Bucketing

For more information on how Optimizely Full Stack SDKs assign users to feature flags and experiments, see [the documentation on how bucketing works](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/experimentation/v4.0.0-full-stack/docs/how-bucketing-works).

## Auto update with Optimizely Webhooks

This example fetches the latest datafile from the Optimizely CDN during every build. [Deploy Hooks](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git/deploy-hooks) from Vercel can be used with [Optimizely Webhooks](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/docs/configure-webhooks#section-2-create-a-webhook-in-optimizely) to keep the application up to date with the latest changes in the Optimizely project.

### Create a Deploy Hook in Vercel

1. Navigate to **Settings** tab in your Vercel deployment.
2. Look for the **Deploy Hooks** section and create a **Hook**.
3. Generate a URL that can be used to trigger a rebuild of the deployment.

### Create a Webhook in Optimizely

1. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/docs/configure-webhooks#section-2-create-a-webhook-in-optimizely) to create a Webhook in your Optimizely project.
2. Use the `Deploy Hook` URL Generated from the previous section to create the Optimizely Webhook.

### How it works

When a user makes a change to the Optimizely Project using the UI, the Webhook hits Vercel's `Deploy Hook` URL to trigger a new build on Vercel. Every new build fetches the latest version of the Optimizely datafile and uses it in the application.

## Set up Optimizely

### Get a free account

You need an account to follow this example. If you do not have an account, you can [register for a free account](https://www.optimizely.com/campaigns/feature-detail-pages/free-feature-flagging/). If you already have an account navigate to your Flags-enabled project.

### Get your SDK Key

1. Go to **Settings > Primary Environment**
2. Copy and save the **SDK Key** for your primary environment. **Note:** Each environment has its own SDK key.
   ![Copy SDK Key](https://files.readme.io/e392205-sdk_key.png)
3. Go back to the **Vercel** dashboard, click on your project and go to **Settings > Environment Variables**
4. Create a new Environment Variable called `OPTIMIZELY_SDK_KEY`
5. Paste your Optimizely SDK Key as its value and **Save**

### Create the feature flag

A feature flag lets you control the users that are exposed to a new feature code in your app. For this example, imagine that you are rolling out a redesigned sorting feature for displaying products.

Create a flag in Optimizely named **product_sort** and give it a variable named **sort_method**:

1. Go to **Flags > Create Flag**.
2. Name the flag key _product_sort_ and click **Create Flag**, which corresponds to the flag key in this example.
3. Go to **Default Variables** and click **New (+)**.
4. Set the variable type to "String".
5. Name the variable _sort_method_, which corresponds to the variable key in this example.
6. Set the variable default value to alphabetical, which represents your old sorting method.
   ![variable sort method](https://files.readme.io/5367828-variable_sort_method.png)
7. Click **Save** at the lower right corner to save the variable.
8. Go to **Variations** and click the default "on" variation. A variation is a wrapper for a collection of variable values.
9. Set the **sort_method** variable value to _popular_first_, which represents your new sorting method.
   ![variation popular](https://files.readme.io/7c41848-variation_popular.png)
10. Click **Save**.

### Create the flag delivery rule

Make a targeted delivery rule for the "on" variation for the _product_sort_ flag. A targeted delivery lets you gradually release a feature flag to users, with the flexibility to roll it back if you encounter bugs.

1. Verify that you are in your primary environment (since you are using the primary environment SDK key):
   ![verify environment](https://files.readme.io/69332d4-verify_env.png)
2. Click _Add Rule_ and select _Targeted Delivery_.
3. Set the traffic slider to 50%. This delivers the flag to 50% of everyone who triggers the flag in this environment. You can roll out or roll back the **product_sort** flag to a percentage of traffic whenever you want.
4. select **On** from the **Deliver** dropdown, .
5. Click **Save**.
   ![deliver on](https://files.readme.io/8ead3e6-Screenshot_docs.png)

6. Enable the flag for your flag rule:
