# Examples Internal

This is the root workspace we use for:

- Maintain and deploy the `@vercel/examples-ui` package that we use for the UI in examples
- Run Playwright on live deployments to constantly check that they're working
- Update templates in [vercel.com/templates](https://vercel.com/templates) using the frontmatter from the READMEs
