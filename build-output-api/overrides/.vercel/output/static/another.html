<h1>Another page</h1>
<ul>
  <li><a href="./">Back to root</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that this page was served <em>without</em> the
  <code>.html</code> extension because the file output was renamed in the
  <code>overrides</code> configuration.
</p>
<p>
  Also note that <a href="/another.html">/another.html</a> will return a 404
  because the output file was renamed from its original name.
